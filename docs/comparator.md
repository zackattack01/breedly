## The compatibility score

### Each feed in the database will be filtered by: 
- inclusion in the user's target age range
    - user's can update the range as needed
- later location will have a cutoff

### Of these, scores will be given according to:
- number of interests that the users have in common
- number of topics that the feed itself has that the user is interested in
- later location will add points depending on how close it is
